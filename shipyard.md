# Shipyard

The `shipyard.yml` file defines the stages each deployment has to go through until it is released into production. 

Shipyard files are defined at the level of a project. This means that all services in a project share the same shipyard configuration. 

## Stages

A shipyard file can consist of any number of stages. A stage has the following properties:

* **Name**: The name of the stage. This name will be used for the GitOps branch and the Kubernetes namespace to which services at this stage will be deployed to.

* **Approval Strategy**: The approval strategy specifies the kind of approval, which is required before deploying an artifact in this stage. The approval strategy can be defined based on the evaluation result `pass` and `warning`. Keptn supports the following approval strategies for the evaluation results `pass` and `warning`:
  * `automatic`: The artifact is deployed automatically.
  * `manual`: Keptn asks for an approval before deploying. 
  
Per default, an `automatic` approval strategy is used for evaluation result `pass` and `warning`.

* **Deployment Strategy**: Defines the deployment strategy used to deploy a new version of a service. Keptn supports deployment strategies of type: 
  * `direct`: Deploys a new version of a service by replacing the old version of the service.
  * `blue_green_service`: Deploys a new version of a service next to the old one. After a successful validation of this new version, it replaces the old one and is marked as stable (i.e., it becomes the `primary`-version).

* **Test Strategy**: Defines the test strategy used to validate a deployment. Failed tests result in an automatic roll-back of the latest deployment in case of a blue/green deployment strategy. Keptn supports tests of type:
  * `functional` 
  * `performance` 
  
* **Remediation Strategy**: The remediation strategy specifies whether remediation actions are enabled or not. To enable remediation actions, the `remediation_strategy` property has to be set to `automated`. The actions are specified in the *Remediation Action* configuration as described [here](./sre.md/#remediation-action).

## Example of a shipyard.yml file

```yaml
stages:
  - name: "dev"
    deployment_strategy: "direct"
    test_strategy: "functional"
  - name: "staging"
    approval_strategy: 
      pass: "automatic"
      warning: "manual"
    deployment_strategy: "blue_green_service"
    test_strategy: "performance"
  - name: "production"
    deployment_strategy: "blue_green_service"
    remediation_strategy: "automated"
```
